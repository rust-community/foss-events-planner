# FOSS events planner

The FOSS events planner is a tool to build your own, flexible event. It's intended to highlight many things that are possible - and how to plan them - while still not giving you a fixed event format.

For that, it documents _features_ of events and some general categorisation of these.

Additionally, the planner gives additional documentation for general subjects (budgeting, accessibility strategy, CFP, etc.).

## Cards

Features take the form of **cards**. Each card holds some basic information:

* A description
* A category
* The why?
* The how?
* Effort
* Plannability
* Budgeting
* Hidden things
* Tasks and time frames
* Suppliers

## Description

The description is a short description of what the feature is.

## The why?

An argument why this feature is useful for. It also describes non-obvious benefits.

## Effort

Effort of implementation is a huge issue for organsiers and sometimes hard to gauge.

## Plannability

How plannable is this feature? Is it something that most likely stays within the effort calculation, or is it something prone to running over time or being delayed?

## Budgeting

Budgeting hints: is this cost per attendee? Is this cost fixed? How much is it in general? Should this item be planned in the "must-have" section of the event or should it be in the "nice-to-have"?

## Hidden things

All the knowledge we have about unpredicted things happening, making the conference a worse experience.

## Tasks and Time frames

This is a list of tasks that must be done to implement this feature and _when_ they should be done to make sure the feature has effect.

## Suppliers

Suppliers that we know of providing this feature.

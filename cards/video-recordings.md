# Video Recordings

## Description

Recordings of all talks on stage.
These should be published later on video platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo or similar for consumption.

## Categorisation

Type:

Implementation difficulty: medium

Appropriate decision time:

## Why?
 
Video recordings allow people to watch the talks again after the conference finished.
It is a good resource as material for the topic of the conference, gives the speakers more exposure to a wider audience and can act as promotion material for the conference.
Making video recordings available for free makes it possible for people who cannot otherwise attend to get access to the discussed topics and ideas.

## How?

Video recordings should be provided by (semi-)professionals.
Good video recordings can take a significant amount of time and effort.

Video recordings need to be provided on site.
Some venues offer video recordings as extra services.
Other venues might give you access to the available audio/video equipment for use by your own video crew.

If possible visit the venue early and clarify these questions.
If hiring an external video crew connect them with the venue technician.

In the video recording contract clarify video editing & cutting services, expected delivery times, licenses.

Prepare required data:

* Schedule in computer-readable format
* Speaker names
* Talk titles, descriptions
* Intro/outro slides, event logo, sponsor logos

Make sure to get consent from all speakers to be recorded and published.

_Note: this might require a signed form from all speakers._

## Effort

This feature requires medium effort.
This will require finding a video recording supplier. The video crew will know the requirements, which needs to be communicated with the venue.
If services are provided by the venue all required hardware setup should already be there.

Early planning makes it go smooth.

## Plannabilty

Easy to plan if you communicate early with both the supplier and the venue.
Ask fellow organisers for trusted suppliers.

## Budgeting

It is a fixed cost, make sure that your pessimistic ticket sale estimate covers it completely.

Price is often in the range of 2000-4000 Euros per day, per event room.

## Hidden Things

The recording is most of the time the simple part.
Cutting and editing the videos can be very time consuming.
That's why, if possible, it's best to hire a (semi-)professional supplier and pay them to do the job.
Good quality videos are a valuable resource.

## Tasks and Time Frames

### Getting a quote

Get a quote and requirements from a supplier, along with a commitment date.

When? As early as possible, before budgeting
Suggestion: 4 months before the event

### Schedule goes to the supplier

Give your schedule skeleton (speaker names,  talk titles and descriptions) to your supplier.
Prepare intro/outro slides or hand required material (event logo, sponsor logos, sound files) to the supplier.

When? Last month before the conference
Suggestion: 2 weeks before the event

### Confirm hardware shipment

Confirm with the supplier that additional hardware is shipped in time (e.g. video camera, cables, ...).
Make sure this material is transpored to the venue on the date of the event (or the day before).

When? Last month before the conference
Suggestion: 1-2 weeks before the event (shipment takes time)

### Recording Setup

The day before the event or early on the day of the event the video crew should have access to the venue.
Clarify if the venue technician is available for the setup.
Professional teams can be ready in less than 2 hours.
If the service is provided by the venue it might not require setup time at all.

# Description

Live transcription is a service that transcribes speakers to text while they are speaking.
It can be imagined as subtitles for the talk.

## Categorisation

Type: accessibility feature 
Implementation difficulty: easy 
Appropriate decision time: early 

## Why?
 
Live transcription allows people with difficulties in oral understanding to follow the talk along nicely. Reasons for understanding problems are diverse. Among them are:

* General difficulties of hearing
* Trying to follow a foreign language
* Speaker accent
* Background noise
* Distraction issues

A good estimate is that live transcription helps around 15% of the attendees, more in a country where the local language is not the language of the conference.

Also, live transcriptions give you the ability to keep the text of the translation around.

## How?

Live transcription should be provided by professionals. It's rare to have trained people around.

Live transcription can be provided remotely or on site. In both cases, an additional screen to show the text is needed. When providing remotely, a stable network for the speakers is needed, to allow the audio feed to be streamed to the supplier.

Live transcription is an exhaustive job, make sure the provider can take appropriate pauses.

Quality of the transcription can be improved by sendin a glossary of used words to the supplier.

## Effort

This feature is very low-effort, usually leading to 1 or 2 calls to a supplier and making sure a second screen is available at the venue.

Early planning makes it go smooth.

## Plannabilty

Very easy to plan, not much room for failure. Ask fellow organisers for trusted suppliers.

## Budgeting

This is an accessibility feature. It should be budgeted before ticket sales and be included in the ticket budget.

It's a fixed cost, make sure that your pessimistic ticket sale estimate covers it completely.

Price is often in the range of 1000-2000 Euros per day, per event room.

## Hidden Things

Speakers that have never spoken with live transcription might have the tendency to joke on the transcribers cost (saying extremely long, complex words, talking extremely fast in their introduction). All these jokes have been done and should be avoided. Please inform your speakers accordingly.

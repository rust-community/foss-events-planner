FOSS Events Planner Roadmap
--

The FOSS events planner is meant to be a tool to help tech community
leaders successfully build their own flexible events.
It will highlight the many things that are possible and how to plan 
them.

> We are working as the Rust community events team to create a set of open event 
> planning guidelines so that tech community organisers can plan and organise 
> tech events, on their own, successfully.

## Create and test prototypes.

> A prototype is an early, unpolished version of your project or a feature of your project,

## User Testing

> to, and their feedback should help answer questions or define a direction for further work

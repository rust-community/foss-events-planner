FOSS Events Planner Roadmap
--

The FOSS events planner is meant to be a tool to help tech community
leaders successfully build their own flexible events.
It will highlight the many things that are possible and how to plan 
them.

There is currently no central place to go for _first-time organisers_
to learn how to run a conference and get _actionable_ tasks out of it,
without building a copy of an already existing event.
The FOSS events planner tries to address this point.

Using the FOSS events planner, people can pick _features_ for their
conference and then get presented with a set of _tasks_. For example,
if you want to run a conference with speaker selection, the tasks will
include "running a call for proposals", "selecting the speakers", etc.
Some tasks might have dependencies, for example, "determining a ticket price"
requires that all tasks of the kind "find out what feature X costs" are done.

With this technique, we're trying to get people to both be aware what's possible,
but also be able to quickly filter by what's relevant for them.

# Contributing

You can contributed to the FOSS events planner in many ways. We want to make sure that everyone can contribute and are happy to help you in that, answering questions, especially providing review and correcting any mistake. This is a writing-heavy project, but if you fear your writing is not good enough for the project: It is, we'll help you there.

## Questions, Issues and Confusion

You read something that confused you or that raised a question for you?

* Make sure you are logged in to GitHub
* Go to the issues tab
* Hit "new issue"
* Give us a short description of your issue with a meaningful title
* Be ready to answer questions
* Thank you and we'll handle it from there!

## Just a quick fix

You found a typo, think something could be phrased better? You would like to help us out?

* Make sure you are logged in to GitHub
* Navigate to the file with the error
* Hit the "edit" pen in the upper right
* Do the fix, write a short description below
* Thank you and we'll handle it from there!
* Be ready to answer questions
* You are now a contributor!

## Write a feature

You have experience with a conference _or_ you want to run one?

The FOSS events planner has a concept called features, described in the [README](README.md).

Not all of them are fully fleshed out, have a look at the issues tab for notes on unwritten ones.
Is it interesting for you? Then:

* Make a comment, notifying people that you want to work on it
* Add a file in `/cards`, copying the template file
* Flesh out the items, filling in your own experiences
* File a Pull Request
* We will review and discuss the text as peers and improve it
* The text will be merged
* You are now a contributor

Please note that not all pull requests are merged, but even unmerged PRs make us find things.

## Adding a new way of viewing things

Currently, the FOSS events planner only has the cards. That doesn't have to stay that way.

If you have an idea for an addition, please tell us!

* Open an issue
* Discuss what form the new view could take
* Come up with some way of make it happen!

You don't need to implement it all yourself, we can arrange!
